### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ayan Raj.

I'm final year undergrad having interest in competetive programming, open source and web development. I beleive that if I'll be able to solve the real life problem with my technical skills, then my learning is perfect. I also help my peers and people who have similar interest through my mentorship and various technical communities like MSP, DSC, Coding Club,etc. Currently, I'm looking for internship or full time job opportunity for SDE role.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web related projects and preparing for the interview.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development and brushing up my DS skills and CS core subjects.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web/ml related projects, hackathons and building communities.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding internship/job opportunity.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web dev, learning, and interview experiences.
